<center><h2>Odisha At a Glance</h2></center>
<p>
Odisha, earlier called Orissa (this name was officially used until 2011), is a state in eastern India. 
It is the 8th largest state in area and the 11th largest in population in India. 
Odisha has the second-largest population of Scheduled Tribes in the country.
</p>

<p>
Odisha shares its borders with Jharkhand and West Bengal in the north, Chhattisgarh in the west, 
and Andhra Pradesh in the south. 
The total area of the state is 155,707 square kilometres, which is about 4.87% of India’s total land area.
</p>

<p>
The state has a long coastline of 485 kilometres along the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. 
In the eastern part of Odisha, there is a coastal plain that stretches from the Subarnarekha River in the north 
to the Rushikulya River in the south. 
Chilika Lake, one of the largest lagoons in Asia, is also located in this coastal plain.
</p>

<p>
The coastal plains are very fertile because they receive rich soil (silt) from six major rivers 
that flow into the Bay of Bengal.
<br>
These rivers are Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Baitarani, Brahmani, Mahanadi, and Rushikulya.
</p>

<p>
Odisha is also known as Utkala, a name that appears in India’s national anthem 
<strong>“Jana Gana Mana”</strong>.
<br>
The main language spoken in Odisha is Odia, which is one of the Classical Languages of India.
</p>

<p>
In ancient times, this region was known as Kalinga.
<br>
It was attacked by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE, leading to the famous Kalinga War.
<br>
Later, the region was regained by King Kharavela.
<br>
The ancient land of Kalinga mostly matches the present-day area of Odisha.
</p>

<p>
The modern state of Odisha was officially formed on <strong>1 April 1936</strong>, 
when the British Indian government created Orissa Province by joining the Odia-speaking areas 
of Bihar and the Orissa region.
